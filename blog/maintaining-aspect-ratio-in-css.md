  How to create a CSS shape that maintains its aspect ratio, and a "gotcha"
  round doing so with Flexbox.

I had to use a bit of a hack this week to ensure that a box always appeared at a 1:1 aspect ratio. Basically, by doing something like:

```css
.box {
  width: 100%;
  padding-top: 100%;
}
```
You can force something to display with the same height and width, since the padding percentage is relative to the width.

However, this _is not_ true of flex children, which this box happened to be. Chrome rendered just fine, but FireFox had different behavior, as documented [here](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=958714#c3) (the FireFox behavior might actually be more correct, I have no idea). Flex childrensâ€™ percentage-padding is relative to the flex-parent.
