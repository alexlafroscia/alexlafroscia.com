[Obsidian][obsidian-md] is a Markdown-based note-taking application with a focus on privacy, flexibility and control over your data.

Currently, it's my note-taking tool of choice; I use it for just about anything I want to plan or remember:

- Daily notes and journaling
- Planning projects and keeping track of progress
- Bookmarking links
- Recording details about friends and family, like gifts I've given them

While I've tried _many_ applications in this space, learning that I really care about owning and controlling the underlying data pushed me to stick with Obsidian. I love that all of the data are in plan text files that live on my devices, and that I have full control to search, edit and interact with them even outside of the Obsidian app itself.
