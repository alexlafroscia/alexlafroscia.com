[Obsidian][obsidian-md] is a Markdown-based note-taking application with a focus on privacy, flexibility and control over your data.

Currently, it's my note-taking tool of choice; I use it for just about everything:

- Daily notes and journaling
- Planning and tracking projects
- Bookmarking links
- Personal CRM

While I've tried _many_ applications in this space and have learned that I really care about owning and controlling the underlying data. I love everything within Obsidian is a normal file that I can open, edit and backup like anything else, and have found it fun and rewarding to have so much flexibility to customize the tool to the workflows that feel right to me!
