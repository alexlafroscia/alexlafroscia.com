This year my wife, [Emily][emily], and I got _pretty into_ [Blue Prince][blue-prince]. Honestly, that's putting it mildly; it was borderline an obsession. Any moments that we weren't playing it we were thinking about it, texting about it or even dreaming about it. If you haven't dug into it yourself, I couldn't recommend it enough.

That said, this isn't a blog post about how great this game is (though, it is); it's actually a post about _how_ we played it, in a technical sense, and the workflow around capturing and organizing screenshots that we developed in order to make sense of the copious notes we took while playing the game.
